### Retrospective

Liked:
- Good issue tracking and communication
- Generally was more structured and productive than the last sprint
- Good communication when help was needed through the use of our Slack

Didn't Like:
- Needed to make sure all logistics were thought out before attempting to implement a feature
- People weren't adhering to code styling guidelines
- Reviewing pull requests was not very structured

Future Adjustments:
- Ensure everyone is up to date on code standards and GitHub workflow (create a master document)
- Plan who will review what pull requests
- Form HTML, CSS, JS teams to get more efficiency & specificity
