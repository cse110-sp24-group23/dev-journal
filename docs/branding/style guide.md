# Style Guide for Web Application

## Web/Mobile Display

For the styles listed below, the layout may change as the user switches from web to mobile.

## Color Palette

- **Primary Color:** `#58a6f5` - Vibrant, inviting, ideal color for buttons and icons.
- **Secondary Color:** `#ebb6b2` - For highlighting important features and calls to action.
- **Background Color:** `#f4f4f4` (Off White) - The background is neutral and light for simplicity.
- **Text Color:** `#333333` (Dark Charcoal) - Ensures excellent readability against the light background.
- **Accent Color:** `#aecfaf` (Matcha Green) - For ‘complete’ messages, links, and progress indicators, etc.

## Accessibility

- **Text to Title Ratio:** All text has a ratio of about 4:1 against its background.
- For example, if a title is 40px, then the text below being 10px will make the website look appealing.
- **Font Sizes:**
  - **Body Text:** 15-18 px - Ensures text is visible at a standard reading distance.
  - **Headings:** Ranging from 22px for H1 to 16px for H6 (Hierarchical sizing).

## Interactive Elements

- Use larger, bolder text for buttons and links to make them easy to identify and click. Minimum size for clickable elements should be 44px by 44px.

## Layout

- **Margins and Padding:** Standardize spacing across all pages to create a uniform look. Suggest 15px for padding in containers and 20px between sections.
